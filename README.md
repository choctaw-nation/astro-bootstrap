# Astro x Bootstrap Starter Kit

Astro x Bootstrap helps CNO Developers start figuring out some of the features (usually JS) and basic Bootstrap configurations of a website before needing to go through the work of setting up data types in WordPress (i.e. Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Field configurations). 

## Quick Start

1. Update `astro.config.mjs` base parameter to be the URL of the new repo you've created
2. Run the following command line script

```sh
npm i && npm start
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
